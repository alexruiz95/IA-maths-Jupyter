    "# Lecture 9 - change of basis\n",
    "\n",
    "This lecture considered a change of basis for vectors and matrices (tensors)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vectors and bases\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector $\\boldsymbol{a}$ is represented in terms of its components $a_{i}$with respect to a given basis, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{a} = a_{1} \\boldsymbol{e}_{1} + a_{2} \\boldsymbol{e}_{2} + a_{3} \\boldsymbol{e}_{3}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(in old-fashioned notation for the canonical basis $\\boldsymbol{i}$, $\\boldsymbol{j}$, $\\boldsymbol{k}$ is used). Using a suitable basis can sometimes simply construction and/or manipulations, but the 'physical' meaning to the vector is unchanged. With respect to a new basis, say ${\\boldsymbol{e}^{\\prime}_{i}}$, the coefficients will change:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{a} = a^{\\prime}_{1} \\boldsymbol{e}^{\\prime}_{1} + a^{\\prime}_{2} \\boldsymbol{e}^{\\prime}_{2} \n",

    "## Coordinate rotations\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering the rotation of vectors, we looked at the rotation of the unit coordinate vectors, $[1, 0, 0]$, $[0, 1, 0]$ and $[0, 0, 1]$ to $\\boldsymbol{q}_{1}$, $\\boldsymbol{q}_{2}$ and $\\boldsymbol{q}_{3}$, respectively. From this, the matrix $\\boldsymbol{Q}$ can be formed:\n",

    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When changing the coordinate system, the vector remains fixed but we rotate the basis. As a consequence, its components will change. If the basis $[1, 0, 0]$, $[0, 1, 0]$ and $[0, 0, 1]$ is rotated to $\\boldsymbol{q}_{1}$, $\\boldsymbol{q}_{2}$ and $\\boldsymbol{q}_{3}$, respectively, the coefficients of a vector $\\boldsymbol{a}$ in the rotated coordinate system are $\\boldsymbol{a}^{\\prime}$ \n",
    "\n",
