      "\n",
      "This collection of IPython notebooks is being produced as an experiment in supporting the teaching of mathematical methods to Part IA students at the Department of Engineering at University of Cambridge in the second half of Michaelmas Term. These notebooks are produced by Garth N. Wells (<http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/~gnw20/>).\n",
